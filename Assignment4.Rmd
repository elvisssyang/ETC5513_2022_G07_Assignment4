### Introduction

@helliwell2012state show with the continuous progress of human society, the happiness index has become an important standard for measuring the family, and people have also begun to study issues related to the happiness index. Since the happiness index is related to many factors of a family, it will also affect the The whole world. Therefore, this part will start with two research questions to explore the happiness index of the world.

##research questionsï¼š

1. How will happiness trends change between 2015 and 2022 in different regions?

2. From 2015 to 2022, What is the relationship between economic health with the happiness In different countries?

### The trends in happiness 2015-2022

```{r trends , fig.cap = "Change of Happiness Score in Different Region", warning = FALSE,message = F}
p1 <- data1 %>% 
  select(Year,
         Happiness_Score,
         Region) %>% 
  
  group_by(Year,
           Region) %>% 
  summarise(Happiness_Score = mean(Happiness_Score,na.rm = T)) %>% 
  
  ungroup() %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(x = Year,y = Happiness_Score,group = Region,color = Region)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = 'Paired') +
  labs(y = 'Happiness Score',
       title = 'Change of Happiness Score in Different Region') +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
plotly::ggplotly(p1)
```
From the Figure \@ref(fig:trends), we can see that the trend in all regions can be divided into three different levels of happiness score.  In all regions , South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa these two regions of overall happiness is the lowest, but Sub-Saharan Africa's happiness began to increase year by year after reaching the trough in 2016, and the South Asia region began in 2018, Happiness is declining year by year. The three regions with the highest overall happiness are: Australia and New Zealand; North America; and Western Europe, and the three regions have changed their happiness by little each year, with a relatively flat trend. Overall well-being is in the middle of the region, with the Central and Eastern Europe region being the only one that is rising year on year, while other regions are in a slightly fluctuating but general trend that is in a more stable state.
